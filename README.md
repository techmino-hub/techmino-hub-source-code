# Techmino Hub Source Code

This repository contains the source code for the Techmino Hub website.  
This website is built using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com), unlike the previous iteration, which used plain HTML, CSS, and JS.

If you trust the workspace on Visual Studio Code, `bun run dev` will automatically be executed when you open the workspace. This is so that you don't have to turn on the development server manually. By default, it starts the development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

If you want to disable this, press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and type "Tasks: Manage Automatic Tasks", then disable automatic tasks.
