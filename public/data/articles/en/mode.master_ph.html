Master PHANTASM is a unique mode of the Master modes,
featuring several unique challenges other than plain 20G and invisible.  

<h2>Sections</h2>

Master PHANTASM consists of 9 sections.

<h3>Section 1 - 0 ~ 11 points</h3>
In this section, you are forced to clear 3 Techrashes in a row. <br>
If you fail to meet this requirement, the game ends prematurely.

<h3>Section 2 - 12 ~ 25 points</h3>
In this section, the Z/S and J/L pieces' colors are swapped. <br>
This makes it easier to mistake those pieces with its mirror.

<h3>Section 3 - 26 ~ 41 points</h3>
In this section, 10 lines of garbage appear. <br>
This isn't your usual multiplayer cheese garbage; it's closer to the "Type B" kind of garbage. <br>
The lower your stack is when you enter this section, the less garbage blocks appear. <br>
If you enter this section without using hold up to this point, you get an extra life as a reward. <br>
You are required to clear all 10 rows of garbage to continue.

<h3>Section 4 - 42 ~ 61 points</h3>
This section is a regular 20G + bone blocks section. <br>
The Hold mechanic is also disabled. <br>
You gain a life upon entering this section.

<h3>Section 5 - 62 ~ 125 points</h3>
This section disables move-reset, making it harder to survive. <br>
The speed here is comparable to the middle stages of Master FINAL. <br>
You gain a life upon entering this section.
