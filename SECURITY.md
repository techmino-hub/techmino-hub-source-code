## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, either in the website or the database, please report it directly by email to `not_a_normal_robot@protonmail.com`.  
I have notifications enabled on that email, so you should expect me to read it in less than 24 hours.  
If I don't respond in 36 hours, try to send a follow-up email; I probably read it but forgot to respond.
