        question: What is Techmino?
        answerHTML: |-
            <p>
                Techmino is a block-stacking game originally made by MrZ, along with
                several improvements by the open-source community. The game is made
                using Love2D. It has many game modes, including Sprint, Marathon,
                VS, a fully-customizable custom mode, and more!

        question: "Why can't I find Techmino in App Store (iOS)?"
        answerHTML: |-
            <p>
                Techmino has received a warning about Copyright infringement from The Tetris Company.
                Techmino is no longer available on the App Store.
                <br>
                A TestFlight was made for Techmino, but unfortunately, the maximum number of members
                had been reached, and therefore, you can't download Techmino on iOS anymore.
                We apologize for the inconvenience. If it says the beta isn't accepting more testers,
                unfortunately, it is not available at this time.
                <br>

                You can try to manually install the .ipa files from GitHub using Sideloadly:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Get the .ipa files from <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino/releases">the GitHub releases page</a>.
                    Find the version you want to install on this page, and then download “Techmino_iOS.ipa”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://sideloadly.io/">Download and install Sideloadly</a>.
                    This application is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.
                </li>

                    Connect your iPhone/iPad/iPod touch to your computer with a USB cable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drag the downloaded .ipa file into the Sideloadly window.
                </li>
                <li>

        question: "I want to play Techmino on iOS or iPadOS without jailbreaking, but I don't see an `.ipa` download on the latest release."
        answerHTML: |-
            <p>If you want to install a version of Techmino that has no ipa builds, you can follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Get the .ipa files from <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino/releases">the GitHub releases page</a>. Find any version with a valid .ipa file, then download “Techmino_iOS.ipa”.</li>
                <li>Change the extension of the .ipa file to .zip. Extract the .zip file.</li>
                <li>Go to ./Payload. If you are using Microsoft Windows, you will see a folder named “Techmino.app”. Open that folder and skip to step 5.</li>
                <li>If you are using macOS, you will see an application file named Techmino.app. Control-click on it, then click on “Show package content” in the context menu.</li>
                <li>Locate game.love. Replace this file using the .love file you intend to install.</li>
                <li>Compress the Techmino iOS file into a .zip file again. Please choose the “no compression” option in your archive app when creating this zip file.</li>
                <li>Change the extension of the new .zip file back to .ipa.</li>
                <li>Follow the instructions of the previous FAQ entry.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Note that builds that are too far back in time may use a different build of LÖVE and may not work properly with this method.</p>

        question: Why am I getting the error related to Cold Clear bot? (And how to fix it?)
        answerHTML: |-
            <p>
                This issue is usually — but not always — caused by missing files required to load the ColdClear bot.
                <br>
                Below is a list of ColdClear's files on different platforms:
            </p>

                        <td>
                            Needs further investigation. <br>
                            PS: It's probable that 2 files are required to build CCloader for iOS.

            <p>How to fix:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Grab the ColdClear wrapper <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/cold_clear_ai_love2d_wrapper/releases">here</a>. (Example: if you want to fix for Windows version, grab the Windows.zip file)</li>
                <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino">Techmino's source code</a> (click the green Code button and click Download ZIP)</li>
                <li>Extract downloaded files to seperate folders (Techmino source code to a folder, CCloader files to a folder)</li>
                <li>Copy necessarily files from CCloader folder to Techmino source code based on the path in the above table (you can check the table above to know the destination of these files).</li>
                <li>Build Techmino. Instructions can be found <a href="https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution">here</a>.</li>

        question: "Remake?"
        answerHTML: |-
            <p>
                On 15 Jan, 2022, MrZ (the main dev of Techmino) opened an issue named “REMAKE NOW” on the GitHub page.
                According to MrZ himself, the current Techmino contains too many bugs that he needs to remake the whole game
                from scratch in order to resolve them.
                <br>
                Although it's still far from complete, you can view the source code <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino_Galaxy">here</a>.

        question: "How can I play Techmino: Galaxy (the remake)?"
        answerHTML: |-
            <p>
                <em>Do understand that Galaxy is still rather early in development,
                and does not necessarily give the best experience.</em>
                <br> <br>
                The easiest way to obtain Techmino: Galaxy is through GitHub Actions. <br>
                (note: you need a GitHub account to download artifacts in GitHub Actions.)
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino_Galaxy/actions">Techmino Galaxy's Actions page.</a></li>
                <li>
                    Select one workflow run from the list. <br>
                    A green tick mark means this run has successfully built all versions without errors. <br>
                    A red cross means there were some errors, but doesn't necessarily mean your version wasn't built successfully.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scroll down to "Artifacts" and download your desired platform's version,
                    or scroll further down to "Post-build summary" for links to mirrors to download from.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Alternatively, obtain the source code and Love2D binary separately,
                and use the Love2D binary to open the source code.
                <br>
                To do this, follow these instructions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://love2d.org/">Get the latest version of LÖVE</a>.</li>
                <li>Download the repo from GitHub (or just run a quick <code>git clone https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino_Galaxy.git</code> if you have Git installed).</li>
                <li>
                    Check if the Zenitha folder is empty. If it is, clone <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Zenitha">Zenitha</a>
                    and put everything inside the folder into Zenitha in Techmino_Galaxy.</li>
                <li>Drag and drop the entire Techmino_Galaxy folder onto love.exe (or love.app, depending on your OS)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Also, if you often update the game, consider following <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino_Galaxy/discussions/26">this guide made by SweetSea</a>.
                <br>
                Note: MrZ does not recommend talking about Techmino: Galaxy's contents,
                especially things that can still change a lot, in public places. <br>
                Unless you have otherwise a good reason, might as well respect his recommendation. Thank you!

        question: "Why does this game only have Sprint?"
        answerHTML: |-
            <p>
                You need to play it in order to unlock the other modes.
                Lines coming out from mode icons indicate whether this mode can unlock other modes.
                To unlock subsequent modes, you need to reach at least B rank on the mode — this would be
                1m 2s for Sprint 10L, or 3m 3s for Sprint 40L.

        question: "Is this Guideline?"
        answerHTML: |-
            <p>
                Close, but no.
                Some more important differences from Guideline are:
                it defaults to a custom rotation system that is based on SRS but has more kicks, has all spin and O-spin.
                This game also has a different attack table.

            <p>
                The game uses two AIs: ColdClear and 9Stacker. <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/MinusKelvin/cold-clear">Cold Clear is developed by MinusKelvin</a>.
                        It is capable of performing T-Spins, Back-to-Backs and Perfect Clears.
                        It is reported to be laggy on low-end devices when playing Battle Royale modes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        9Stacker is a more "stupid" algorithm, capable of only finesse and hard dropping.

        question: "How do I extract, view, or replace the game's assets and code?"
        answerHTML: |-
            <p>
                The Techmino.exe file (Windows) or game.love file (anything else) are valid zip archives.
                Using a software like 7-Zip, you can view, extract or replace any file(s) in it,
                including assets and lua scripts.
                <br>
                Alternatively, you can check out the game's <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino">source code on GitHub</a>.

        question: "Anti-addiction system?"
        answerHTML: |-
            <p>
                The game has an anti-addiction system that prevents playing for too long.
                It only takes into effect if you're playing the game in Chinese with a Sprint 10L time of over 10s,
                a Sprint 40L time of over 32.6s, and you have been playing for 4 hours.
                The timer resets on midnight.
                Although this feature isn't required because the game hasn't been registered in China,
                it's still a pretty cool Easter egg.

                Previously we demanded that you ask for permission before doing so,

        question: "My game crashed/closed without a bluescreen!"
        answerHTML: |-
            <p>
                If the crash happened while an AI player is loaded (eg, in a VS mode game or on the title screen),
                it is likely an issue of Cold Clear, the bot AI we use.
                We can't do much about it. <br>
                You can still try to ask around about the crash, especially when it happens without an AI on screen.

                You can do it by clicking or pressing the “TECHMINO” icon on the home page

        question: "My external keyboard isn’t working with Techmino!"
        answerHTML: |-
            <p>
                Try plugging and unplugging your keyboard, or reconnecting your keyboard
                if you are using a Bluetooth keyboard.
                This kind of issue typically only happens on mobile devices.
                For iOS and iPadOS users, that is an issue we can not fix for now.
                This might be related to the iOS distro of LÖVE or how iOS recognises external keyboards.
                At the same time, you can still use the on-screen virtual keys.

                This is because Techmino isn’t on the Mac App Store. <br>
                To fix this issue, go to System Preferences &gt; Security & Privacy. <br>
                Click on the lock icon on the lower-left corner and enter your password (or use Touch ID). <br>
                Then, select “App Store and identified developers” under the “Allow apps downloaded from” menu. <br>

                You probably have enabled “Simplistic Mode.”

                Simply go to the settings and uncheck the “Simplistic Mode” to fix it.

        question: I see an icon that is like the "thinking" emoji, but with a Z tetromino. What is this?
        answerHTML: |-
            <p>
                It means “Tetris”!
                Due to possible risk of receiving DMCAs from TTC, we have decided
                to replace all instances of the word “Tetris” in the game with 󰀕.

        question: "How can I view the rank requirements for each mode?"
        answerHTML: |-
            <p>
                First, go to our <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino/">GitHub repo</a>,
                then navigate to <code>/parts/modes</code> to find the mode file (<code>.lua</code>) you want to open. <br>
                After that, look for a piece of the code that looks like this (this will going to be different for each mode;
                    this example uses <code>sprint_40l.lua</code>): <br>
                <pre>
                    <code>
            if P.stat.row<40 then return end
            local T=P.stat.time
            return
                T<=26 and 5 or
                T<=36 and 4 or
                T<=52.6 and 3 or
                T<=92.9 and 2 or
                T<=183 and 1 or
                0
            end,</code></pre>
                <br>
                The first line means that if <code>P.stat.row</code> is less than 40 (which means that you didn’t finish the 40L sprint), your grade is not recorded. <br>
                The variable’s name that goes after <code>local</code> is the category of the requirement (in this example, time (in seconds)). <br>
                The <code>5</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>1</code> correspond to <code>X</code>, <code>U</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>A</code>, and <code>B</code> grades in the game.
                <code>0</code> also means your grade is not recorded (in this example, when your time exceeds 183 seconds).

                <td>
                    <p>There are two kinds of O-spins: transformative O-spins and translational O-spins. Transformative O-spins are only possible with TRS, while translational O-spins are possible with TRS, BiRS, and ASC; so make sure you have the correct rotation system.
                    <br>To perform a transformative O-spin, move the O block in an appropriate “hole,” then use the following rotations to do the trick:
                    <br><pre><code>

                    <p>To perform a translational O-spin, you can use the fact that some rotation systems have kicks, and use that to put the O-piece in a hole. A notable oddity is BiRS, where you have to hold the correct arrow keys (move left/right/soft drop) to try to "bias" the kick in that direction, and then trying to rotate the O-piece. More info is available in the in-game Zictionary.</p>

        answerHTML: |-
            <p>
                If you really want to test out the latest features of Techmino, the <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino/actions">GitHub CI</a>
                would generate a snapshot version of the app for every commit.
                Note that the snapshot versions might be unstable and contain many bugs,
                and that you need to be logged in to your GitHub account to download the artifacts (game builds). <br>
                If you want to test them out on iOS devices, you need to install the <code>.ipa</code> files manually.

        answerHTML: |-
            <p>
                Unfortunately, the ARM distros of Linux are not yet supported by LÖVE, so you cannot do that.
                If you really want to play it on your device, we recommend you to use box64/box86 with Wine
                to run the Windows distro of the game.
                Note that you cannot open .AppImage files using box64/86 directly.

            <p>
                Apparently, this is a bug that happens in iOS.
                The “Portrait” mode in settings seems to do nothing on iOS.
                Therefore, the only solution is to enter Techmino in landscape mode:
            </p> <br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Swipe up from the bottom of the screen or double-tap the home button to enter App Switcher,
                    then swipe up to quit Techmino.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Disable the rotation lock if you haven’t already.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rotate your device to landscape mode.
                    It is okay if the contents on the home screen don’t seem to be rotated to landscape view — this is normal
                    as long as you hold the device in a landscape manner.
                </li>
                <li>Enter Techmino. Everything should be okay now.</li>
            </ol> <br>
            <p>Note that if you “swipe quit” the app again, you may need to repeat the procedure above.</p>

        question: "How do I configure touch screen controls in Techmino Galaxy?"
        answerHTML: |-
            <p>
                Touch screen controls work slightly differently from the original Techmino,
                and you need to visit two screens to fully set up touch controls.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Turn on the "Enable touch controls" switch and click the "Touch controls..." button</li>
                <li>
                    On this screen, you can add, remove, move, resize buttons
                    (but they don't have actions assigned to them yet)
                </li>
                <li>Go back, and enter "Key mappings..."</li>
                <li>On this screen, click an action, then click a button to assign the button an action</li>
            </ul>

        question: "In Techmino Galaxy, how do I unlock all the music tracks?"
        answerHTML: |-
            <p>
                In the music room, turn off the BGM volume on the bottom right,
                stop the music in bottom middle, and spam click "full band" on the bottom left. <br>
                Alternatively, press alt+` (backtick) to unlock them temporarily.

        question: "When will Tech League (ranked matchmaking) come out?"
        answerHTML: |-
            <p>
                Probably never. According to MrZ:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    … I don't plan to do [Tech League right now]…
                    The previous system is not good as expected,
                    if I want to do it I will rather add it to Techmino Galaxy…
                    When I finish that, [I] will change the old button to an ad [for Techmino Galaxy’s “League”].
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Key takeaway: Tech League will be implemented in Techmino Galaxy in the future.
                It will not be implemented in the “Classic” Techmino.
            </p>
